<div class="problem">Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
<br />
<p class="center_copy">1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...</p>
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.</div>

<br />
This is a pretty easy and interesting problem regarding the Fibonacci sequence. Looking the problem at a high level, we want to sum each 'row' of the Fibonacci sequence as seen in the cool visualization bellow:

In order to solve this in R, I implemented a very simple algorithm: create the Fibonacci sequence with terms under 4 million, subset for the even numbers, and finally just sum it.
