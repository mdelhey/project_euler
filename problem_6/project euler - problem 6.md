<div class="problem">The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is:
<br />
<p class="center_copy">12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385</p>
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is:
<p class="center_copy">(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025</p>
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025  385 = 2640.
<br /><br />
Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.</div>

<br />
This one's an easy one! No real explanation needed here, just using the summation and square functions on a vector containing the first hundred natural numbers.
